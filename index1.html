    Mercedes-Benz has developed multi-concept cars with alternative propulsion, such as hybrid-electric,
    fully electric, and fuel-cell powertrains.At the 2007 Frankfurt motor show, Mercedes-Benz showed 
    seven hybrid models, including the F700 concept car, powered by a hybrid-electric drivetrain
    featuring the DiesOtto engine. In 2009, Mercedes-Benz displayed three BlueZERO 
    concepts at the North American International Auto Show.Each car features a different powertrain 
    - battery-electric, fuel-cell electric, and gasoline-electric hybrid. In the same year,
    Mercedes also showed the Vision S500 PHEV concept with a 19 miles (31 km) all-electric range
    and CO2 emissions of 74 grams/km in the New European Driving Cycle.Since 2002, Mercedes-Benz has
    developed the F-Cell fuel cell vehicle. The current version, based on the B-Class, has a 250-mile
     range and is available for lease, with volume production scheduled to begin in 2014. Mercedes has 
     also announced the SLS AMG E-Cell, a fully electric version of the SLS sports car, with deliveries 
     expected in 2013.The Mercedes-Benz S400 BlueHYBRID[61] was launched in 2009, and is the first production 
     automotive hybrid in the world  to use a lithium-ion battery. In mid-2010, production commenced on the Vito
      E-Cell all-electric van. Mercedes expects 100 vehicles to be produced by the end of 2010 and a further 2000 by the end of 2011.
